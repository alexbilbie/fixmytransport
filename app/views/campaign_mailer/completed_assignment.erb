Hi admins!

<%= @campaign.initiator.name %> thinks that <%= @assignment.data[:organization_name] %> is responsible for the <%= @campaign.location.description %>. 


Dear, Kind, Beautiful Admins,

My little robotic brain has just spotted that <%= @campaign.initiator.name %> has told us that <%= @assignment.data[:organization_name] %> is responsible for the <%= @campaign.location.description %>. 

If this seems right, then add the operator, and update the assignment. If it looks dodgy then please have a quick google.

Lots of love - the FixMyTransport Computer

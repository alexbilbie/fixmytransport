Hi<%= " #{raw @user.name}" %>,

Important news: we've updated our data, and it looks like the operator for <%- if @location.is_a?(Route) %>the <%- end %><%= raw @location.description %> has changed. It is now the responsibility of <%= @links.keys.to_sentence %>.

We're letting you know about this in case writing to the new operator will help you resolve the issue you raised in "<%= raw @campaign.title %>".

<%- @links.each do |operator_name, link| %>
To write to <%= raw operator_name %>, click on the link below:

<%= raw link %>

<%- end %>

If your issue has been fixed, you can mark it as fixed from your public page:

<%= raw @campaign_link %>

Hope that's helpful,

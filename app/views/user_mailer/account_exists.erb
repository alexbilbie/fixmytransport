Hi <%= raw @user.name %>,

You just tried to sign up to FixMyTransport, but you already have an account. Your account details have been left as they previously were.

Please click on the link below to sign in<%-if @action%><%= raw " and #{ raw @action}"%><%- end %>:

<%= raw @account_confirmation_url %>

If your email program does not let you click on this link, copy and paste it into your web browser and press return. If you continue to have problems please contact us.

You can then use the account page to change your password if you like. 
<%= render :partial => 'shared/mailer/model_confirmation', :locals => { :model => @unconfirmed_model }%>

Thanks,

Hi <%= raw @user.name %>,

You just tried to sign up to FixMyTransport, when you
already have already got an account, but haven't set a password on it.

Please click on the link below to log in<%-if @action%><%=" and #{@action}"%><%- end %>:

<%= raw @account_confirmation_url %>

If your email program does not let you click on this link, copy
and paste it into your web browser and press return. If you continue to have problems please contact us.

You can then use the account page to set a password on your account if you like. 
<%= render :partial => 'shared/mailer/model_confirmation', :locals => { :model => @unconfirmed_model }%>
Yours,

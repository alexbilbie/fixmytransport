      <h4>What is this site? </h4>
      <p>
        FixMyTransport was built with the aim of connecting and empowering people who share public transport problems of different kinds. 
      </p>
      <h4>Where does the data come from? </h4>
      <p>
        The site uses several public transport datasets - the <a href="http://data.gov.uk/dataset/naptan">National Public Transport Access Nodes (NaPTAN)</a>, the <a href="http://data.gov.uk/dataset/nptg">National Public Transport Gazetteer (NPTG)</a> and the <a href="http://data.gov.uk/dataset/nptdr/">National Public Transport Data Repository (NPTDR)</a>. The code that runs FixMyTransport is open source, and available <a href="http://github.com/mysociety/fixmytransport">on github,</a>  if you want to build a similar site or just see how we built this one.
      </p>
      <h4>Who built it? </h4>
      <p>
        FixMyTransport was built by mySociety, an organisation that grew out of the community of volunteers who built sites like <a href="http://www.theyworkforyou.com">TheyWorkForYou.com</a>. mySocietyâ€™s primary mission is to build internet projects to give people simple, tangible benefits in the civic and community aspects of their lives. Our first project was <a href="http://www.writetothem.com">WriteToThem</a>, where you can write to any of your elected representatives, for free. We are run as part of a charity called UK Citizens Online Democracy, and our charity number is 1076346. The site design is by <a href="http://www.supercooldesign.co.uk/">Supercool</a> (yes, they are).

      <h4>What will you do with my data? </h4>
      <p>
        We ask for your email address so that the transport organisation who's responsible for your problem can write back to you, and also so that we can send you updates about your problem. But we don't do anything else with it.

  %p Brief Encounters was built by mySociety, the project of a registered charity which has grown out of the community of volunteers who built sites like <a href="http://www.theyworkforyou.com">TheyWorkForYou.com</a>. mySocietyâ€™s primary mission is to build Internet projects which give people simple, tangible benefits in the civic and community aspects of their lives. Our first project was <a href="http://www.writetothem.com">WriteToThem</a>, where you can write to any of your elected representatives, for free. The charity is called UK Citizens Online Democracy and is charity number 1076346.
